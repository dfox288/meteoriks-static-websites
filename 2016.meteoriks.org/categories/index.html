<p>As a first step, everyone will be able to propose&nbsp;categories&nbsp;for inclusion in the awards. At the same time, you can apply to become a juror for one or more categories, including the newly proposed categories. At the end of the first phase, all jurors who are accepted decide upon which categories will be included in the awards<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;(approximately 10)</span>, and only categories with enough jurors will be accepted. Only two categories are guaranteed to be included: Public Choice&nbsp;and Best New Talent.</p>

					<p>A Celebration of 2d - providing a solid foundation for creativity.<p>
					<a href="#" class="show-category-description" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#category-description">read more</a>
					<div class="detail hide">Traditionally, 2d art at one time was very important in productions - on older platforms, it was often the primary way of delivering 'design' or 'direction.'  It's not particularly easy to do such using only 2d, either.  It could also provide "something to look at while the next section loads."

These days, it's less used in productions as people do more with sculpting via 3d or using shaders... but it's still important:

Every flyer for a party, every bigscreen ad, every sticker, and every T-shirt design fits within this category.

Every 'handdrawn' compo picture, and in many cases, 'computer aided' - 3d techniques made to assist the 2d artwork - they all fit this category.

It's a broad category, but in my opinion far too large to not be mentioned.

HOWEVER: Most photography is more about using 3d space to create a scene than using 2d.  While 2d can enter into it, the MAJORITY of photography entries would not fit this category.

Because this category is so wide already, effects that create a 2d image without use of an artist's direction - such as a 'tunnel effect' mapped to 2d (or whatever the colorful scene is about 2/3 of the way through 'Pulse' on Atari ST by Checksum) should NOT be shoehorned into it.  That is an effect best recognized as wicked code effect (or contrasted with this category - showing both are techniques worth exploring.)</div>
