<p>As a first step, everyone will be able to propose&nbsp;categories&nbsp;for inclusion in the awards. At the same time, you can apply to become a juror for one or more categories, including the newly proposed categories. At the end of the first phase, all jurors who are accepted decide upon which categories will be included in the awards<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;(approximately 10)</span>, and only categories with enough jurors will be accepted. Only two categories are guaranteed to be included: Public Choice&nbsp;and Best New Talent.</p>

While previous scene awards have also honored these fields their impact has rarely been considered in a more holistic sense.
